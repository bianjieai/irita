# Hardware Wallet for Secure Enterprise-Level Custodian Service

## Background

Hardware wallets are essential for blockchain ecosystems. They provide security and utility when interacting with blockchains and creating transactions. Compare to software wallets that are always exposed to internet threats, hardware wallets offer an extra layer of protection against cyber-attacks, phishing sites, and malware.

Recently, more and more institutions are building their businesses with crypto assets. These institutions need to address their pain points in asset custodial management (managing users' private keys)  while taking care of custody security, internal control, compliance, and other aspects, reducing the complexity of the risk management system's design, development, and management.

Bianjie.AI has partnered with iBest to provide a secure and trusted enterprise custodian solution that supports managing crypto assets issued on Cosmos SDK based blockchains. Currently, the solution has been implemented and deployed to support a global digital bank's production operation.

## Enterprise solution

This solution has been implemented for Asia Digital Bank(AsiaDB), an innovative global digital asset operator in Malaysia, in [building a new-generation digital banking system](https://medium.com/irisnet-blog/asia-digital-bank-adopts-cosmos-tech-to-build-new-generation-of-digital-banking-system-2bc5aec7384b) .

Powered by Cosmos' scalable, sovereign, and interoperable blockchain tech stack, and its enterprise suite IRITA, AsiaDB's clients can manage centralized bank accounts and accounts on open distributed ledgers connected through Cosmos' Hubs. It also serves as a paradigm for compliant self-service financial systems and services.
